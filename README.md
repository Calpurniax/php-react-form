# PHP with vite
This is a register form I created with PHP to handle the DB connection and vite/React for the client side.

## Backend
To run the backend:
``` docker compose up -d``` 
or
``` docker compose up ```
to watch request in terminal
Back would be listen in http://localhost:52000/



## Frontend
To install dependencies in front, from that folder run:
```npm install``` 
To start the app:
```npm run dev``` 
Front will be in http://localhost:5173/
